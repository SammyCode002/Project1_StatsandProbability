#Technology Usage Among College Students Analysis

Project Overview 
This project explores the evolving patterns of technology usage among college students from 2008 to 2023. Utilizing data from surveys on device preferences and usage hours, we aim to understand trends, preferences, and the impact of digital devices on the academic and social lives of students.

Features 
Analysis of technology usage trends over time. 
Identification of popular devices among college students. 
Examination of outliers and their impact on average usage times. 
Visualization of data through histograms, box plots, and line graphs. 

Installation 
To run this project, you'll need Python installed on your system. 
Additionally, the project requires the following Python libraries:

Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn 

You can install these libraries using pip:

bash Copy code pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn 

Usage
 To use this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab. 
Run the cells sequentially to perform the analysis and generate the visuals. 

Data 
The dataset used in this project (Cleaned_Technology_Data.xlsx) contains the following columns:

Year: The year of observation. 
Device: The type of technology device. 
College Students: The number of college students using the device. 
Hours Using: The average hours spent using the device. 

Visualizations 
The project generates several key visualizations:

Histogram of device usage hours to identify central tendencies and outliers. 
Box plot to further analyze the distribution of usage hours. 
Line graph showing the trend of device usage over the years.
